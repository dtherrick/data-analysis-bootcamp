      "    * Most possibilities end up limited by the set of tools used.\n",

      "    * Most tools are thrown in as free extras to pad a feature list - so they may lack production strength and ease of use.\n",
      "    \n",
      "* In our section on analytics, we emphasized the importance of understanding your models, and not relying entirely on black box solutions.\n",
      "    * This matters very much in working with BI packages.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Always ask how useful and relevant the results are.\n",
