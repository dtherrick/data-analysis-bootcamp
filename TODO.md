Here are a bunch of things I'm thinking about:
=============================================

1. Remove first babies example
2. Replace with the Kaggle Titanic example
    * Excel -> Python -> Pandas -> Random Forest
3. Add a Tableau section to the last day
4. Give thought to actual exercises
    * make a few simple ones to do during the section
    * end with a single, more comprehensive team exercise.
5. Improve the first section on statistics.
    * use the notebooks added to complement the existing content.
